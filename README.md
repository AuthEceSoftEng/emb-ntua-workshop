# emb-ntua-workshop

This workshop discusses introductory concepts of machine learning and data mining following a hands-on approach using popular tools and libraries such as [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable) and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org).

The sessions of the workshop include:
- 1_BrainRun: Application on Behavioral Biometrics
- 2_RiskFactors: Application on Behavioral Biometrics

Instructions for running the workshop at repl.it:
1. Navigate to https://repl.it
2. Click on `Start coding` and login with your GitHub account
3. Select `Import from GitHub`
4. In the text field write `AuthEceSoftEng/emb-ntua-workshop`
5. Click on 'Import from GitHub'

After repl.it opens up, run the following commands at the console (on the right):  
`python -m poetry lock`  
`python -m poetry install`

You 're all set! Open any script to see the code and run it using commands (e.g. `python3 1_BrainRun/code.py`).  
You can also write `python` in the console to run the interpreter and execute the commands one-by-one.
